    - This example shows the code generation for structures like If and Else, as well as assigns and 
    function calls.

    - java -jar yal2jvm examples/aval8.yal

array1.yal

    - This example shows the code generation for While loops, as well as array instantiation and
    access. It also has a loop inside one, so it is possible to verify the code generation in that specific situation.

    - java -jar yal2jvm examples/array1.yal

constant-ranges.yal

    - This example shows the code generation for the different sizes of a constant. 

    - java -jar yal2jvm examples/constant-ranges.yal

aval6.yal

    - This example shows the code generation of different types of operators between variables or constants.
